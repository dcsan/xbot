Treatment for:
“Escape From Bell Hill” (Asylum #6) VERSION 2

Commands: look, get, use, use x with y, talk to, ask about, sleep, open, close, wash, do, inventory

You accept an invitation to playtest a new physical escape room. The setting of the game is a mental asylum called "Bell Hill".

Having signed the game’s online terms & conditions and a standard NDA, you climb into bed early Friday night, full of anticipation.

After all, you love escape rooms.

> sleep

# prologue

Saturday morning, you arrive at the venue and are greeted by a female host wearing a white lab coat. After placing your belongings in a locker, you are led down a long hallway to a simple bedroom. In the game, you will play the role of a male inmate of Bell Hill. Your goal is to escape the asylum.

> ask about time

The host informs you the game will last one hour, followed by a short debrief. If you are ever stuck or want to leave, just say the safe word “MACARONI”.

She wishes you good luck and exits through the door by which you came. It closes seamlessly, becoming part of a blank wall of the room.

> look room

You have just begun to examine your surroundings when the *real* door of the room opens, and two burly men dressed as what you take to be orderlies enter.

> talk to orderlies

Before you can speak, one of the orderlies locks you in bear-like grip while the other strips your pants off your legs. Your shirt is torn off next, leaving you only in your underwear and socks.

> ask about clothes

“Is this part of the game?!” you stammer angrily.?

“It’s all in the terms and conditions,” says the first orderly.

“Looking forward to your escape attempts!” chuckles the other, following his partner out.

“Geesh,” you think, “That’s maybe a bit much…”

The door shuts with a resounding click.

 “Okay,” you think to yourself. “Maybe this is a bit much for a Saturday morning…”

 The orderlies appear behind her.

> ask woman about game

“This isn’t a game…” she gurgles.

“Without a moment’s hesitation, one of the orderlies draws a handgun and fires three quick rounds. The deafening cracks of each roll and echo around the hallway sickeningly as you watch her collapse in a pool of… fake blood?

“Okay. You’ve had enough. This isn’t fun.

The men advance on you.

The lights in the facility drop out with a heavy crack, and the hallway is bathed in sickly green light. The rough hands of the orderlies grab you and drag you in the opposite direction of the host.

 “You should have read the terms and conditions more carefully, Jack.”
