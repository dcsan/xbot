## Installing and setting up the Escape Bot (XBOT)

You need to have some type of 'verify' setup for your server, as the bot doesn't currently use a prefix.

## Roles

Make a role for the bot. It needs:
  read write and emoji reactions

Install the bot from here:
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=759874591694389279&scope=bot

add that role to the bot

## Bot Admin Commands
Make another role called one of these (case sensitive)
admin|mod|staff|Hint Giver|Escape Room staff|Bot Dev|Escape Host

Better to have it as a separate new admin role than your current one in case you give out to someone else.

Give yourself that role. Now you (and only you) can use admin commands on the bot.
These are:

- clear - clears history in the channel
- gt (room) - jump right to a specific room (eg cell or lobby) (we don't have that many rooms yet but we will... :D)
- reset - resets current player
- st - status - for debugging

Enjoy!
