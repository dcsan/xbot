You get a good night’s rest.

Saturday late morning, you arrive at the venue and are greeted by a host wearing a white lab coat. After placing all of your personal belongings in a locker, you are ushered down a long hallway which leads directly into the first room of the game: a simple bedroom for you, a male inmate of Bell Hill.

The host informs you that the game will last one hour and will be followed by a debrief. If you are ever stuck or want to leave, just say the safe word “macaroni”. She then wishes you good luck and exits through the door by which you both came. The door closes seamlessly behind, becoming part of a blank wall of the room.
